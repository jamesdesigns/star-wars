## Naboo

Nothing says romance like visiting Naboo’s Lake Country where Anakin and Padmé were married — just don’t think about all the heartache that followed their wedding. Relax in the elegant capital city of Theed and see the Festival of Light or explore the planet’s hills and plains.

Areas to avoid: Theed Generator Complex
