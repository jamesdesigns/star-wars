## Serenno

Count Dookuâ€™s home planet is nothing to sneeze at. Those looking for a place to hideaway from it all for a while might put Serenno at the top of the list. The mountains and cliff-side homes offer seclusion and privacy in a lovely setting. Plan a long stay, pack some books, and disconnect from the HoloNet.

Areas to avoid: Anywhere Count Dooku has been spotted
